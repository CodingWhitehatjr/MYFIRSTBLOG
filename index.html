                <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">One place I would really reccommend to visit is Paris. </h5>
                <p class="text-muted text-left">It’s an amazing structure that’s beautiful to look at night and day, near and far. Touristy or not, a visit to Paris would not be complete without feasting your eyes on the world’s most recognized structure. The tower was built by French architect and engineer Gustave Eiffel (who also designed the STATUE OF LIBERTY) in 1889. It was constructed for the Exposition Universelle, celebrating 100 years since the French Revolution.</p>

                <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">Another place in my mind is the Leaning Tower of Pisa. </h5>
                <p class="text-muted text-left">The bell tower (now bell-less to relieve weight from the structure) and the the spectacular cathedral are the highlights of visiting Pisa. Everything gleams. The church, the bell tower. It’s all limestone structures coated in white marble and it’s stunning. Even more though, this strong tall marble juts at a precarious angle from the ground. With the church nearby, and other tall and straight buildings in contrast, it seems like a building better suited for a Ripley’s Believe It Or Not Museum.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">The Taj Mahal originally the Rauza-i-munawwara is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees. The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.</p>

                <p>This movie was very good. It had lots of adventure, comedy and Fantasy. You can watch this movie with your family and friends. The video quality is also very good. But, this movie was missing something. The movie didn't have much adventure like the book did. It was also missing many parts that the book had. And they got the story completley wrong. The quest part of it was right, but from there they messed up the movie. They changed the story from the book to the movie. Overall this was a very good movie. </p>

                <p>This Movie was AMAZING. This is a great movie to watch if you enjoy horror and sci-fi. This movie is about a 16 year old teenager boy named Thomas, who gets trapped in a grassy farmland called the Glade, with cement walls around it. The cements walls are the maze. The maze is the only way out of the Glade. Thomas and his friends solve the maze and escape with 20 other Gladers. This is a great movie to watch with yor family and friends, and it has very good video quality! </p>

                <p>This movie was overall great. This movie had great video quality. Harry Potter is one of my favorite book series, but this movie was one of my favorites. This movie had many parts from the book, but they added more parts that the book didn't have, which I really enjoyed. Thos movie is very similar to the book, but it had more comedy and adventure then the book did. It expressed the characters less then the book did, but they made the character look right and adorable. This is a good movie to watch with your family, and kids.</p>

                <p>This movie was good. It is a good movie to watch with siblings or family. It has good video quality, but the only problem is that this movie is very lengthy. It does have the same story as the cartoon Cinderella, but this movie has many songs. Children also might get scared of Cinderella's mice. I wouldn't really reccommend this movie for kids. Other than that this movie was amazing. </p>

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>
